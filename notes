EXAMPLES: 


Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.

Use only the find and cp commands. You will need to utilize the -exec option on find to accomplish this activity.

The find command uses BOOLEAN "!" to designate that it does not want to find any files or directories that follows.

ANSWER: 
      find $HOME/1123/ -type f -name '*.txt' ! -name '*~.txt' -exec cp {} $HOME/1123 $HOME/CUT \;





 Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT.
 
Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory.

Omit the names filename from your output.


ANSWER: 

ls -p $HOME/CUT | grep -v "/$"| grep -v "names" > $HOME/CUT/names
